Functions used to calculate inter-voxel similarity and temporal autocorrelation as presented here:
https://doi.org/10.1101/179655

Both scripts assume that the input is BOLD timecourses extracted per voxel. 
Each row is assumed to be a TR and each column is assumed to be a voxel (see example data).
